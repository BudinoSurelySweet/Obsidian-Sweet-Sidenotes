## Introduction

After doing some research, I found out about the existence of sidenotes, particularly tufte. I looked to see if there might already be a snippet for Obsidian somewhere, but I couldn't find it, so I decided to create it myself. Thus was born Sweet Sidenotes, a snippet that through callouts allows you to get an aesthetically beautiful sidenote.

## How to install

1. Download the css file inside the css folder inside `<vault name>/.obsidian/snippets`.
2. Enable the snippets under the Appearance section in the settings.
3. Download the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin in order to customize the snippet and also to make it work.
